Road Trip Mileage Calculator
==========

This is a simple web app that takes a few user inputs (origin city, car fuel type, car mileage, vacation category interest) and returns a list of suggested destinations with driving distance, time and fuel cost. 

Distance and time is calculated via Google's Distance API. Fuel cost is calculated from this data and from the up-to-date national price averages (via a government XML feed, cleaned up through Yahoo's YQL).  

For the time being, you can see the demo at my Github hosted account URL: http://sudominnix.github.com

This is a work-in-process intended as an exercise in learning Javascript. I may add other features in the future as well as refine some of the code. Perhaps you might have use for this as a rough basis for a similar application or maybe you just need a few pieces of code (such as the XML parsing) for something else.
